# Stock Visualization

This program uses LangChain and yfinance to create an LLM for visualizing and describing stocks. This is a work in progress â€“ you may encounter bugs.

Use *streamlit run front_end.py* to run the program. 

This project was created under the LLM Augmentation MDST Winter '24 team. 
The LLM Augmentation W'24 repository can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/W24-llm-augmentation/tree/main)).
